For index search, we use Indexing.py to index all documents in citeseer2 dataset, then use search_indexed_docs.py to search on the indexed docs.
For semantic search, we use SemanticDocEncoder.py to encode all documents, then use SemanticSearch.py to search semantically with the keywords.
For user interface, we use streamlit for front-end design.

If we want to run the code for searching, we need to use this command:
streamlit run **.py
